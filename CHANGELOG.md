## [0.2.0] - unreleased

- **New:** Elements now emit `connected`, `ready` and `disconnected` lifecycle events that bubble up the DOM tree.
- **Breaking Change:** ðŸ’¥ Completely revamped the ticker system to make it easier to use, and make three-elements more straight-forward to integrate with web application frameworks:
  - Ticker callbacks have been renamed from `onupdate`, `onlateupdate`, `onframe` and `onrender` to `ontick`, `onlatetick`, `onframewtick` and `onrendertick`.
  - Ticker events now are normal CustomEvents, meaning that you would implement callbacks like any other DOM event callback, eg. `ontick="(e) => console.log(e)"`.
  - You can also directly subscribe to these events through `element.addEventListener`, but in this case you may need to explicitly set the element's `ticking` attribute/property to true in order for it to actually connect to the game's ticker.
  - Ticker events have an `event.detail.deltaTime` property that stores the delta time, but you can also get it directly from the game object via `element.game.deltaTime`.

## [0.1.3] - 2021-01-13

- **Fixed:** compatibility with frameworks that set `ontick` & friends directly as properties (eg. Svelte)

## [0.1.2] - 2021-01-13

- **Fixed:** All of the built-in elements now check if they're already defined before attempting to define themselves again. This is useful for development environments with hot reload or HMR, where they would otherwise raise an error about tags already having been defined.

## [0.1.1] - 2021-01-12

- **Changed:** The `<three-game>` element now has width: 100%, height: 100% and display: block applied to it by default. If you just plug it into the `<body>`, it will use the full display area; if it has a parent element, it will automatically expand its size to fill that. You can, however, also directly style the `three-game` element. The web is a beautiful place!

## [0.1.0] - 2021-01-12

- First release. Let's do this!
