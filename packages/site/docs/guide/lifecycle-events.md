# Lifecycle Events

::: warning TODO
Lifecycle events are currently reworked. In the currently available version of three-elements, elements dispatch `connected` and `mounted` DOM events when they connect or complete their initialisation, respectively. These events bubble up the DOM tree.

Please note that this is _extremely likely_ to change in an upcoming version, so please use this with caution.
