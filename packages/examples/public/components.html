      Since three-elements provides its main functionality as HTML tags, it can be
      used with pretty much any component-based framework you throw at it. The
      library also allows you to create new web components (custom elements) based on
      its own implementation of them. To do so, just inherit from the `ThreeElement`
      class -- if you use the `ThreeElement.for(className)` helper method, you'll
      extend a class that manages an instance of the Three.js class you specify.

      This is useful if you want to make your component automatically support
      attributes being forwarded to the Three.js object. In this example, we
      introduce a custom "speed" attribute, but also forward the other attributes
      -- like `scale` -- to a THREE.Mesh instance that is managed by the element.

        The mountedCallback will be invoked after the element has been successfully
